# A.S.D-Learning-Zone

A.S.D. Learning Zone application ia a web application that provides resources to those that are affected by autism spectrum disorder. 
Most of the time parents don't know how to interact with or teach their children after such a diagnosis and that's where the Learning Zone steps
in. Whether it be level 1- level 2 - level 3-, this website will provide different ways of learning to communicate and learn.  Because of there being so many
individual levels this site will include experiences for all who apply themselves. 

HIPPA Standards will most definitely apply, due to the many medical instances rendered within this site. This is why JWT tokens will be issued upon login for security measures. 

With each click the Learning Zone will make resources available to the user. It will allow parents and all users to stay ahead to the learning curve for each members mental/learning
pattern so that we can better assist in their developmental challenges.  It will link virtual support groups, gaming sites, everyday learning tips, schools and care centers, books and much more
